<p>Hello! Hope these projects help you as they helped me to learn Python.</p>


<!--- Project Heading for Dice_Data_Vis_PyGal -->
<head>
    <h3 align="left">
    Rolling Dice with Analysis and Visualization using PyGal
    </h3>
</head>

<p>This project shows how a program develops over multiple stages. The original idea which I expanded upon came from the textbook - Python Crash Course - a good book for a beginner. The entire project is located in the folder titled, <b>Dice_Data_Vis_PyGal</b>, and includes several subfolders, each demonstrating a unique stage as the program grows. Enjoy.

                    - <b> Die_Single_No_Input </b> - project begins with a single die being rolled a certain number of times. After analyzing the data, it is then displayed as a chart.
                    <br>    
                    - <b> Die_Single </b> - project incorporates user input.
                    <br>
                    - <b> Dice_Same_Num_of_Sides </b> - project evolves by rolling more than one die, but each die has the same number of sides.
                    <br>
                    - <b> Dice_Multiple_Num_of_Sides </b> - project allows the user to define the number of sides for each die.
                    <br>
                    - Finally, if I have time, as my Data Science program begins 17Jan, the data visualization will evolve to include the percentage of each die's contribution to the total frequency for each possible rolled value.
